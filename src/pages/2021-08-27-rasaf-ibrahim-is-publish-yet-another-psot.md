  **In February** 2002,** *the developers started creating language-code based
  sub-domains for different language Wikipedias. Along with other Wikipedia
  sub-domains, Bengali language sub-domain was created at that
  time.[***\[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_Wikipedia#cite_note-7) A
  placeholder page was created automatically in that sub-domain on June 1,
  2002.\[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_Wikipedia#cite_note-8) On
  December 9, 2003, A Bangladeshi Ph.D. student of Canada's McGill University
  named Shah Asaduzzaman emailed Wikipedia Founder [Jimmy
  Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Wales "Jimmy Wales") with a request
  to create Bengali
  Wikipedia.\[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_Wikipedia#cite_note-9)\[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_Wikipedia#cite_note-Kalerkantho-10) As
  a result, the developers created a test page on the Wikipedia named "Home
  Page" on December 26 of the same
  year.\[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_Wikipedia#cite_note-Kalerkantho-10)


  The Main Page of Bengali Wikipedia was created on January 27, 2004, from an IP address which marks the official beginning of Bengali Wikipedia. '[বাংলা ভাষা](https://bn.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%82%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BE_%E0%A6%AD%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B7%E0%A6%BE "bn:বাংলা ভাষা")' ("Bānglā Bhāshā"; Bengali Language in English) is the first article of Bengali Wikipedia which was created on May 24, 2004.
