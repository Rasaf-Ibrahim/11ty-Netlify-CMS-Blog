The main education system is divided into three levels:

Primary level (class 1–8)[6]
Secondary level (9–12): There is no middle school system in Bangladesh.[7]
Tertiary level
At all levels of schooling, students can choose to receive their education in English or Bangla. Private schools tend to make use of English-based study media while government-sponsored schools use Bangla.
