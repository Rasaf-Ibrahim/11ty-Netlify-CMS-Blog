<p>Bogura is named after Nasiruddin Bughra Khan, the Governor of Bengal from 1279 to 1282 and the son of Delhi Sultan Ghiyasuddin Balban.</p>
<p>The city is approximately 69.56 km2 (26.86 sq mi) and is divided into 21 wards. Bogura has a population of around 540,000 people. Since it is one of the oldest cities in Bengal, Bogura is famous for its many ancient Buddhist stupas, Hindu temples, and ancient palaces of Buddhist kings and Muslim sultans.</p>

    ### 11ty uses trailing slash. So, you should use trailing slash in the html otherwise the code of styling the active menu item based on URL will not work.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    If you check, you will find out that 11ty uses trailing slashes! Example - 
    
    http://localhost:8080/blog/
    
    http://localhost:8080/about/
    
    
    So, when you are writing html, you need to make sure that you are using trailing slashes! Example - 
    
    <a href="/blog/">Blog</a>
    <a href="/about/">About</a>
    
    If you don't use trailing slashes in the html, like the following example:
    
    <a href="/blog">Blog</a>
    <a href="/about">About</a>
    
    it will still work. You will be able to navigate without any problem. But you will have problem if you want to style active item. 
    
    
    Suppose, you are in the blog page. If you check 'location.href' in the console, it will be: 
    
    'http://localhost:8080/blog/'
    
    
    But if you don't use trailing slash in the html and if you check 'document.querySelectorAll('a')[i].href' for the blog page, it will be:
    
    'http://localhost:8080/blog'
    
    
    
    So, `location.href` and  `document.querySelectorAll('a')[i].href` will not be the same if you don't use trailing slash in the html. 
    
    And your code of styling the active item based on URL will not work as you need to check `document.querySelectorAll('a')[i].href === location.href` for that.
    
    
    So, make sure that you are using trailing slash in the html as 11ty uses trailing slash.
